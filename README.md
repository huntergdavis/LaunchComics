A very simple app to open a bunch of http links at once.
For whatever reason, there isn't a single web browser on android that allows "open all bookmarks in tabs" functionality.
So, I threw my comics bookmarks into a url intent launcher, and here it was.

----- Update - June 2015 -----
I've updated this to follow the list/detail flow view paradigm.
1.  Only pre-loads comics on the days they are supposed to come out
2.  Internal webviews mean no launching external browser or filling its cache
